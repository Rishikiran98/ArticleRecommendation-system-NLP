# ArticleRecommendation-system-NLP

TED Talks, known for their wealth of knowl-
edge and diverse ideas, continue to serve as an
invaluable resource for students and researchers
across various domains. Whether used as a
foundational resource or for the in-depth explo-
ration of technical concepts, these talks remain
a wellspring of inspiration and wisdom. Our
aim is to harness the power of Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) techniques to extract
valuable insights from the transcripts and de-
scriptions of these talks. The project focuses
on generating tags from transcripts. This paper
presents our experiments and comparisons of
three different models, ranging from simple lo-
gistic regression to custom transformer-based
architectures. Additionally, the paper outlines
the development of a recommendation system
using tags generated by the model.
